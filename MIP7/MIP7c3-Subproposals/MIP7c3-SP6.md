Proposed Applicant: Sam MacPherson

## Application Form

### Domain Team Introduction

* The Smart Contract Domain team has been working on implementing updates to the protocol, onboarding new collateral types, and writing spells to adjust governance approved risk params.

### Motivation

The DAO does not have a mandated Smart Contracts Facilitator, and as such we are currently reliant on the Maker Foundation for support. I believe it is in the interest of the protocol to have an autonomous Smart Contracts team outside of the Foundation.

I believe I can fill this role as I have more or less been doing this with the organization of the PSM, DssGovRewards and other community-led projects.

### Work Credentials

**Work Experience:**

- MakerDAO Smart Contracts dev since August 2020
- 17 years software engineering experience
- CTO of Bellwood Studios Inc - a game development company
- Experience with web, games and broadcast television software
