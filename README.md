# Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) 

## Introduction

MIPs are the preferred mechanism for improving both Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol. Through an open and documented process, community feedback will be collected to reach the broadest possible consensus on how the Maker Protocol should evolve. 

Furthermore, MIPs will provide a mechanism for any community member to define key issues and suggest changes and additions to the system. MIPs will allow for a high level of transparency, rigor, and community input in order to minimize undesirable results from the process. In most cases, MIPs will be arranged in sets (multiple MIPs that are interdependent but together solve a single problem, risk, or opportunity through one or more processes).
