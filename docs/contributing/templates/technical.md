**Summary**

A short description of what the Maker Improvement Proposal (MIP) is focused on.

**Motivation**

A short description of the motivation behind the proposed technical solution. 

**Specification**

The details of the proposed technical solution. The specification should be detailed enough to allow an implementation team to begin development as well as testing.


- **Proposed Code:**
    -  The final code that can be used directly in the executive vote to accept or reject the MIP.


- **Test Cases:**
    - For the implementation or testing of the proposed code
- **Security Considerations**

    - This is one of the most important aspects of the Technical MIP proposal. The purpose of this section is to proactively document any security-relevant design information, decisions, potential failure modes, implementation details, and important discussions related to the proposed change. This section helps to optimize the MIP process by providing proactive guidance on security considerations when proposing a change that will affect the Maker Protocol.
    - Backwards compatibility

- **Auditor Information and Report**

    - This section includes the audit partner details and the final audit report for the proposed code.
