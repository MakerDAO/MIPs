description: A brief overview of how to contribute to the MIP process, as well as some templates for the various kinds of MIPS

# Contributing Guidelines

To learn more about the purpose of MIPs and how to start writing a MIP, please start by reading the following resources: 

1. [Announcement: Kickstarting the Self-Sustaining MakerDAO Initiative](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/announcement-kickstarting-the-self-sustaining-makerdao-initiative/1864)
2. [The Maker Foundationâ€™s Vision of a Self-sustaining MakerDAO: Initiation of Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Framework](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-maker-foundation-s-vision-of-a-self-sustaining-makerdao-initiation-of-maker-improvement-proposals-mips-framework/1882)
3. [The Release of the 13 Initial Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-release-of-the-13-initial-maker-improvement-proposals-mips/1915)
4. [MIP0: The Maker Improvement Proposal Framework](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip0-the-maker-improvement-proposal-framework/1902)
5. After reading through the above materials, prospective MIP Authors should first propose their proposal on the [MakerDAO Forums](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/MIPS/14) as well as complete the other criteria laid out in the `Conception` phase of the MIPs Lifecycle (described below).

## Important Notes

1. When creating a MIP, clone the MIPs repository from GitHub, and start by filling out the appropriate [MIP template](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/mip0.md#mip0c6-mip-templates).
2. When submitting a Pull Request (PR) for a MIP proposal, be sure to include the following details:
    1. Pull Request Title:`MIP#: MIP Title`
    2. In the PR comment box, please include the MIP's premable. This includes the following:
        ```
        MIP#:
        Title: 
        Author(s):
        Type:
        Status: Conception
        Date Proposed: <year-month-day>
        Dependencies: n/a
        Replaces: n/a
        ```
    3. In the **RFC Phase**, community members may propose changes to proposed MIPs. When proposing changes to MIPs in the RFC Phase, clone the MIPs repository from GitHub, and then make a Pull Request (PR) for the respetive MIP with the following details: 
        1. PR title: `Add/Change/Delete <details> to MIP#`
        2. In the PR comment box, include a short description of the proposed change. 

Note that is it ultimately up to the MIP Author to decide whether or not these proposed changes or addtions will be included in the final version of the MIP.
