### Motivation

With the successful launch of Multi-Collateral Dai and impressive growth of the Protocol that leaves us with $100M in annual revenues, **Maker's first significant contribution, a decentralized stablecoin**, has been established. We are now facing our **second big challenge: sustainably scaling the decentralized ecosystem** while **avoiding critical failure scenarios**.

While the recipe for successfully scaling a centralized organization is quite well known, **sustainably scaling decentralized organizations is mainly uncharted territory**. We believe that it is critical for the success of the Protocol to **systematically research** the topic and **continuously improve** the efficiency of the decentralized economy as it grows.


#### Mission

> Sustainably grow the Maker Protocol's moats by systematically removing barriers between the decentralized workforce, capital, and work.

#### Vision

> To support a decentralized, effective, and scalable economy on top of the Maker Protocol that continues to push forward its growth in a sustainable manner.
>
> This decentralized, effective, and scalable economy:  
> 1. Has the best and most successful **onboarding experience** for new participants, with the highest **retention rate** in the industry.
> 2. Allows everyone to **find the capital they need** to work on **the best projects** which (1) optimally drive protocol growth and (2) are most fulfilling for its participants.
> 3. Has **resilient safety mechanisms** in place that **prevent protocol failure** while leaving ample space for **rapid innovation and experimentation.**


### Core Unit ID

SES-001

### Core Unit Name

Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling

### Core Unit Mandate

In order to support growing the Maker Protocol’s moats, SES will follow a strategy that is structured as a **continuous improvement cycle**, with research and development at its core. Iterating through this cycle will systematically **drive the ecosystem closer to the vision** that was outlined.

In a typical iteration: (1) new scaling bottlenecks are first identified, (2) research is then conducted on how to remove these bottlenecks, and, finally, (3) activities are funded and kick-started to implement practical solutions in line with the research.

#### Opportunity and Risk Assessment

Because the problem space is so large, it will be critical that we do not attempt to solve every problem at once but instead focus solely on a set of carefully selected priorities.
- **Identify opportunities and risks** affecting the sustainable scaling of the ecosystem through engagement with the different DAO stakeholders.
- **Maintain an open backlog** of these opportunities and risks, and make it accessible to the broader community.
- **Define research projects** to act on the opportunities and risks that are documented in the backlog. Each project has a clear set of Objectives and Key Results.
- **Prioritize** these research projects based on (1) what **the greatest need** is and (2) **the most significant impact** that the team can have with their set of skills and expertise.

#### Research

Systematic research will target the identified bottlenecks, leading to repeatable solutions that help the ecosystem scale sustainably.
- **Assemble the right team** and appoint a project lead to **work on the following priority** on the roadmap.
- **Coordinate stakeholder engagement** and reach alignment on the **objectives and key results** of the project.
- **Collect the necessary data and develop models** to verify research assumptions and offer insight into the problem. Publish the results for the community.
- **Explore solutions and frameworks** that produce high-quality, repeatable results.

#### Incubate

Our research must not be purely academic but, instead, be firmly grounded in reality. The produced solutions need to be implemented and maintained in the long run: incubation is a critical element of our strategy.

- **Identify areas of activity** that our research shows would contribute to more efficient and sustainable ecosystem scaling.
- **Connect individuals and teams** to conduct these activities continuously. Set the team up for success to become an **independent Core Unit.**
- **Guide and support** the team throughout the process, including (1) conception, (2) team formation, (3) legal setup, (4) budgeting, (5) partner outreach, (6) communication/transparency reporting, and (7) governance MIP approval.

#### Sponsorship

![SES Sponsorship Program - Overview](https://i.imgur.com/7avA2TQ.png)

Next to the continuous improvement cycle to promote new solutions for sustainable ecosystem scaling, the core unit will also engage in related Sponsorship (and Advisory) activities.

- **Incubation Program Funding** provides the necessary financial support for incubator teams to be paid throughout the program, until the publication of their MIP and governance approval of their own budget.
- **Scholarship Grants** identify and test a potential Contributor before making a longer-term commitment in a Core Unit or with the DAO.
- **Micro-Grants** are intended to test an idea by building an MVP with minimal scope. For experimentation and discovery.
- **Development Grants** are aimed at the conception and development of a platform or product that requires a more significant effort.

#### Advisory

There is no formal reporting and management structure in the decentralized ecosystem, as is typical for centralized organizations. We believe that a secondary, advisory function performed by mature Core Units will be critical for covering those needs.

We plan the following advisory activities through partnerships with other core units:
- Help teams to conduct **transparency reporting**, establish **best practices**, and organize **self-accountability auditing.**
- Offer **ceremonies facilitation** for core units that do not have a full-time agile coach.
- Act as **trusted third party for Dark Spells** to verify critical protocol vulnerabilities and confirm the necessity for a dark spell and the correctness of its implementation.

## Transparency Reporting and Self-Accountability

We believe that sustainable scaling of a decentralized organization will require a great deal of **transparency reporting** and **self-accountability mechanisms** to perform the function of traditional alignment, reporting and evaluation mechanisms found in centralized organizations.

Apart from the research that we will conduct around this, we'll start with applying a number of practices in our own core unit to explore their dynamics and potentially set an example for others to follow:

1. **Objectives and Key Results** for all our projects as the primary way of communicating goals and tracking progress against those goals. These OKRs will be published on a website that will be kept up-to-date all the time, so that everyone can inspect not just what we're working on, but also what has already been achieved.

2. **Weekly Status Update Calls** with a documentation trail that can easily be reviewed by anyone who is interested. These calls are already happening every Friday at 14:30 UTC. Every week, an overarching topic is formulated to make the archive more accessible.

3. **Standardized Core Unit Documentation** -- We believe that with a growing number of core units in the ecosystem, the need will arise for standardized reporting about several aspects of the team's activities, goals, and performance. While no standard exists today, we have structured our own core unit documentation in a format that we hope can be reused by others, including the projects in our incubator program.
    [» Review the Core Unit Documentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/14a_jh42VPdZNiT7wJfH5N_W95WkLDImk)

4. **Self-Accountability Audits** -- Last but not least, we're introducing the notion of self-accountability audits, whereby we will work with an independent external party in the community to:

    * Work out and **agree on best practices and standards** that we want to hold ourselves accountable to as a team.
    * **Publicly commit** to following this set of best practices and standards.
    * Have **regular reviews** with the third party to audit the team's operations, assess to what extent these practices are followed in reality, and formulate improvements where needed.
    * Have a **public record** of these audits available for full transparency.

    We are currently talking with **Seb Derivaux** to implement this and will update the RFC with more details soon.

While we are pionering these practices with our own Core Unit, we will be able to support other Core Units through our Advisory Program to implement similar mechanisms based on our own experience.
