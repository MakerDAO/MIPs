## Application

### Motivation

I've been helping different people across teams for some time now, learning as much as I could, and stepping up when I thought it was appropriate.

Internally, I've been working with Amy Jung, LongForWisdom, and the Mandated Actors, and I believe that I would complement their skillset to achieve scale and decentralization.

The Operational Support domain is an accumulation of a lot of the work weâ€™ve been doing in the background. Given my experience, I would primarily* focus on:

- **People:** help the different teams to translate strategy into the needed skills, profiling, budgeting, and recruiting strategy. Onboarding, training, and scaling of the teams (knowledge transfer).
- **Financial and Operational Health:** financial models / KPIs, compensation improvement + tracking, operational performance; assist with decentralization.
- **Product Growth:** customer(s) journey definition, acquisition, onboarding and feedback loops, metrics / KPIs, product development, assist with  integrations and partnerships (if applicable)

*I'm expecting these to shift as the DAO evolves, but Collateral Onboarding is the main objective for the foreseeable future.
