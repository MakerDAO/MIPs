- Permanent Team members may act as project leads, participate in them and/or work to support the Incubation Program teams.
- Incubation Team members will operate as much as possible in the same role that they will fullfill in their future Core Unit. Through coaching and guidance, we will work with them to further improve their understanding of each team member's role and responsibilities.
- Roles and responsibilities will be documented and shared as part of our Core Unit documentation.
- Best practices that we identify will be shared within the Core Unit, as well as the wider Community whenever relevant.
