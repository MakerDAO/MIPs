### Budget Details

_Providing additional detail with regards to the above line items;_

**Salaries**: The current team has 1 full-time Facilitator and 1 full-time Project Manager. The team may seek to grow this by 1 full-time member. This opportunity to scale will enable us to better meet the demands of our team’ mandate and goals.

**Hourly Compensation**: The team also consists of multiple part-time contributors, who will be compensated on an hourly basis. These are roles that require less than 25hrs per week.

**Healthcare**: In order to align with traditional company offerings, this proposal includes a healthcare supplement averaging $1250 p/month for full-time employees, based on residency to account for local cost variations.

**Sign-on Expenses**: Provided at the discretion of the Facilitator to attract top talent to the team. This will cover Opolis setup costs for full-time team members.

**Travel & Events**: Facilitator and Senior Project Manager may travel to present at industry events, participate in team or larger MakerDAO offsites.

**Legal and Operating Expenses**: Coverage for managing general operational overhead, legal costs including entity creation, legal officer/company insurance, as well as monthly and annual financial reporting.

**Contingency Buffer**: Approximately 10% of budgeted costs in the event that we underestimated this budget cycle or need to grow the team.

### What the budget does not include

Unincluded items that may end up being an expense are covered by the Contingency Buffer and will be added to an updated budget in the future, if such items exist.

### Conditions - Continuous Operation

To ensure continuous operation in the event of an Emergency Shutdown or a failed monthly budget Executive Vote we are requesting an up-front lump-sum of $82,500 to sit in a protocol-owned multi-sig. This amount covers three months of operating expenses.

Detail:

* The lump-sum will be held outside of the surplus buffer in a protocol owned multisig.
* If normal protocol operation is not possible due to emergency shutdown or other protocol failure, these funds will be used to ensure continued service by GovComms.
* At the conclusion of the year, the lump sum will remain in the multisig for the following year.
* The lump-sum may be updated if the team grows or shrinks.

### MKR Vesting

The Governance Communications Team is interested in some version of MKR vesting for its team members. Instead of offering our own unique proposal now, we will wait for the community to come to consensus around how Core Units should set this up. We support the formation of an overarching MKR Vesting framework that all Core Units can follow.
