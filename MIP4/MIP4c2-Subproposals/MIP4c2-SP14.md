## Preamble

MIP4c2-SP#: #14
MIP to be amended: MIP0
Author(s): @blimpa, @elihu

Status: RFC
Date of Amendment Submission: 2021-03-31
Date of ratification:
```

## Specification

### Motivation

Over time, MIP0 has accrued a moderately heavy baggage of outdated content and a somewhat lighter baggage of rushed edits and incoherence. We feel it is high time MIP0 got a revamp that trims down the excess, brings it up-to-date, and makes it less intimidating for the newcomer and easier to navigate for everyone.

Although not shy in reformatting and rewriting, the proposed changes neither add nor break any preexisting functionally relevant logic. We think this warrants their current collective presentation as an amendment rather than as a replacement.
